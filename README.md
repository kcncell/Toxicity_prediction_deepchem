# Toxicity_prediction_deepchem
This repository contains the python note book for DeepChem tutorial: Train a neural network usingTox21 dataset.
This tutorial was inspired by the book "Deep learning for the life sciences" By B. Ramasundar, P. Eastman, P. Walters, and V. Pande.
Link to the book: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492039822/
I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the application of machine learning to problems related to life science, chemistry, and biochemistry.
